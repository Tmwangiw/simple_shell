This is a pair programming project to write a simple UNIX command interpreter.

The shell displays a prompt and waits for the user to enter a command.
The shell then reads the command and breaks it into tokens to be executed.

Finally, the shell iterates and waits for the to exit or an end of file condition is reached.
